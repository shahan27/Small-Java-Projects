# Java-Game
Learning to make java games with Marcus Dubreuil's youtube series:
"Java game programming tutorial for AP students/equivalent level - In one video! "

This is a repository of code I wrote following along Marcus' video with plans to expand additional features to gain a deeper
understanding of how to make games in java. 

To run, run main in Game.java
